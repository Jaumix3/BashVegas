*Three Gamblers Making Gambling Not So Bad*

This is a casino made in Bash, so you can gamble without worrying about your money. We all know you're poor (just like us).

Simply clone the repository locally and run the script in your terminal.

If you encounter any issues, please reach out to us by creating a PR, and we'll help you as much as we can. And of course, feel free to ask ChatGPT as well!

Finally, we are developing this for a class project, but it's cool to share it with all of you, and it's not the official version, we are developing new things and making a few commits per day. 

Thanks for your attention.

BashVegas Team.
